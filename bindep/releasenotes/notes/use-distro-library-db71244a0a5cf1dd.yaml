    Bindep now depends on the distro python library to determine details
    about the current platform. This library looks at both /etc/os-release
    and lsb_release to find platform info. The os-release file data is
    preferred and at times has slightly different data than lsb_release.
    Every effort has been made to make this transition backward compatible
    but some things may have been missed.

    The motivation for this change is that not all distros have lsb_release
    available and we can let the distro library sort that out for us.
